  ┃  sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper

  ┃  Thinking: Can't run sudo without a password. Let me give the DORK instructions to do it themselves.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
     The DORK needs to run this one-time setup in Terminal:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
     sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
     It'll ask for their Mac password. After that, they'll be able to use simulators.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
     Once that's done, they can run:                                                                                                             ⬖ Getting started                ✕     
     xcrun simctl list devices available                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                   OpenCode includes free models        
     Then boot a simulator and install the app from the GitHub Actions artifact.                                                                   so you can start immediately.        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
     Want me to create a simple script the DORK can run to do all this?                                                                            Connect from 75+ providers to
